The project was to add animations to the three buttons on the provided website. 
I chose to do all three buttons in different shades of purple. 
The first button is white with a neon purple border and text. When you hover over the button it glows and changes the button to neon purple, with white text. 
i used a box shadow to make the glowing effect. 
The second button is a white background with a light purple border and text. It also has a  continuous loop of the border moving around the button. I chose this animation because it's eye-catching. 
The third button has a plum purple background with white text that changes to a white background and plum text when you hover over the button. I chose this because I like plum colours.
